## API Design

### RESTful Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a RESTful API following standard HTTP methods and resource-based routing.

**Rationale**:

- RESTful design provides a familiar, intuitive interface for developers
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) clearly communicate intent
- Resource-based URLs (`/users`, `/projects`, `/tasks`) create a logical hierarchy
- Stateless nature enables horizontal scaling

**Trade-offs**: REST is less flexible than GraphQL for complex queries, but the simplicity and widespread adoption made it the better choice for this use case.

### Modular Blueprint Architecture

**Decision**: Organize code into Flask Blueprints by feature (`auth`, `users`, `projects`, `tasks`).

**Rationale**:

- Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability
- Each module can be developed and tested independently
- Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- Follows single responsibility principle
- Enables potential future microservices migration

**Alternative considered**: Monolithic structure was rejected due to reduced maintainability as the project grows.

### Response Format Standardization

**Decision**: All endpoints return JSON with consistent structure and HTTP status codes.

**Rationale**:

- Predictable responses simplify client-side development
- Standard error format (`{"error": "message"}`) enables centralized error handling
- ISO 8601 timestamps ensure timezone clarity
- Pagination parameters (`limit`, `offset`) follow common conventions

## Database Schema

### Simple Three-Table Design

**Decision**: Use three core tables (Users, Projects, Tasks) with clear foreign key relationships.

**Schema**:

```text
User (1) ─── (N) Project (1) ─── (N) Task
```

**Rationale**:

- Minimal complexity while meeting all functional requirements
- Clear ownership model (users own projects, projects contain tasks)
- Cascade deletes maintain referential integrity automatically
- Easy to understand and query

**Alternative considered**: Many-to-many relationship between users and projects was considered but rejected due to YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle - the additional complexity wasn't justified by current requirements.

### Indexing Strategy

**Decision**: Create indexes on frequently queried columns:

- `users.email` (unique index)
- `projects.user_id` (foreign key index)
- `tasks.project_id` (foreign key index)

**Rationale**:

- Email-based authentication requires fast user lookups
- Project filtering by owner is a common operation
- Task queries by project are performance-critical
- Foreign key indexes improve JOIN performance

**Trade-offs**: Indexes consume storage space and slow down writes slightly, but read performance gains justify this for a read-heavy application.

### Timestamp Management

**Decision**: Every table includes `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps, automatically managed.

**Rationale**:

- Audit trail for all data changes
- Enables sorting by creation/modification time
- Supports potential future features (activity feeds, change tracking)
- UTC storage prevents timezone confusion

### SQLite for Development, PostgreSQL-Ready

**Decision**: Use SQLite by default with configuration support for PostgreSQL.

**Rationale**:

- SQLite enables zero-configuration local development
- No external database service required for testing
- SQLAlchemy ORM abstracts database differences
- Production can easily switch to PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

## Authentication & Security

### JWT Token-Based Authentication

**Decision**: Implement stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens with separate access and refresh tokens.

**Token Lifetimes**:

- Access token: 1 hour
- Refresh token: 30 days

**Rationale**:

- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage required, enabling horizontal scaling
- **Decoupled**: Frontend and backend can be deployed independently
- **Mobile-friendly**: Tokens work seamlessly in mobile apps
- **Refresh mechanism**: Short-lived access tokens limit exposure while refresh tokens provide convenience

**Alternatives considered**:

- **Session-based auth**: Rejected due to scaling complexity (requires shared session store)
- **OAuth 2.0**: Overkill for this use case; adds unnecessary complexity without third-party integration needs

**Trade-offs**: JWT tokens cannot be revoked before expiration. Mitigated by short access token lifetime and refresh token rotation strategy.

### Bcrypt Password Hashing

**Decision**: Hash passwords using bcrypt with automatic salting.

**Rationale**:

- Industry-standard for password hashing
- Built-in salt generation prevents rainbow table attacks
- Adaptive cost factor allows increasing complexity over time
- Slow by design, making brute-force attacks impractical

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Decision**: Implement two user roles (Manager, Employee) with decorator-based authorization.

**Roles**:

- **Manager**: Full CRUD access to users, projects, and tasks
- **Employee**: Read access + task management

**Rationale**:

- Simple two-tier system meets current requirements
- Decorator pattern (`@manager_required`) keeps authorization logic DRY
- Easy to extend with additional roles if needed
- Centralized authorization logic in middleware reduces bugs

**Alternative considered**: Attribute-based access control (ABAC) was too complex for current needs.

## Optimizations

### Lazy Loading with Opt-In Includes

**Decision**: Related data (projects in user responses, tasks in project responses) is not included by default but can be requested via query parameters.

**Examples**:

- `GET /users/1?include_projects=true`
- `GET /projects/1?include_tasks=true`

**Rationale**:

- Reduces payload size for common queries (N+1 problem avoidance)
- Clients only fetch data they need, reducing bandwidth
- Improves response times for simple queries
- SQLAlchemy's lazy loading prevents unnecessary database hits

**Trade-offs**: Requires clients to know about include parameters, but documentation makes this clear.

### Pagination Support

**Decision**: List endpoints support `limit` and `offset` query parameters.

**Defaults**: Sensible defaults prevent accidentally loading thousands of records.

**Rationale**:

- Prevents performance degradation with large datasets
- Reduces memory consumption on server
- Enables efficient client-side infinite scroll implementations
- Standard pattern familiar to developers

### In-Memory Testing Database

**Decision**: Tests use SQLite in-memory database (`:memory:`).

**Rationale**:

- Extremely fast test execution (no disk I/O)
- Clean state for each test run
- No test pollution between runs
- Reduces CI/CD pipeline time

### Connection Pooling

**Decision**: SQLAlchemy's built-in connection pooling is enabled by default.

**Rationale**:

- Reuses database connections, reducing overhead
- Handles connection lifecycle automatically
- Improves throughput under concurrent load
- Zero configuration required

### Input Validation Layer

**Decision**: Separate validator modules for each feature (`validators.py` in each blueprint).

**Rationale**:

- Early request rejection saves database queries
- Centralized validation logic prevents duplication
- Clear error messages improve developer experience
- Separates validation from business logic

**Example**: Email format validation, required field checks, enum validation for user types and task statuses.

### Structured Logging with Loguru

**Decision**: Use Loguru instead of Python's standard logging module.

**Rationale**:

- Color-coded console output improves development experience
- Structured logging supports future log aggregation
- Zero configuration with sensible defaults
- Better exception formatting and context

**Trade-offs**: Additional dependency, but benefits outweigh the minimal overhead.

## Summary of Key Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
2. **Standards**: Follow REST conventions and HTTP standards
3. **Scalability**: Stateless design enables horizontal scaling
4. **Security**: Defense in depth (JWT + bcrypt + validation)
5. **Maintainability**: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
6. **Performance**: Strategic indexing and lazy loading
7. **Developer Experience**: Consistent APIs, good documentation, helpful error messages

## Future Considerations

As the application grows, these areas may warrant revisiting:

- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Search**: Full-text search for projects/tasks (Elasticsearch)
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse
- **WebSockets**: Real-time task updates
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive change tracking
- **Multi-tenancy**: Organization-level data isolation

These were intentionally deferred following YAGNI principle - implement when actually needed, not speculatively.
