Design Rationale
=================

This document explains the key design decisions, architectural choices, and optimizations implemented in the Project Management API.

API Design
----------

RESTful Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Implement a RESTful API following standard HTTP methods and resource-based routing.

**Rationale**:

* RESTful design provides a familiar, intuitive interface for developers
* Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) clearly communicate intent
* Resource-based URLs (``/users``, ``/projects``, ``/tasks``) create a logical hierarchy
* Stateless nature enables horizontal scaling

**Trade-offs**: REST is less flexible than GraphQL for complex queries, but the simplicity and widespread adoption made it the better choice for this use case.

Modular Blueprint Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Organize code into Flask Blueprints by feature (``auth``, ``users``, ``projects``, ``tasks``).

**Rationale**:

* Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability
* Each module can be developed and tested independently
* Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
* Follows single responsibility principle
* Enables potential future microservices migration

**Alternative considered**: Monolithic structure was rejected due to reduced maintainability as the project grows.

Response Format Standardization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: All endpoints return JSON with consistent structure and HTTP status codes.

**Rationale**:

* Predictable responses simplify client-side development
* Standard error format (``{"error": "message"}``) enables centralized error handling
* ISO 8601 timestamps ensure timezone clarity
* Pagination parameters (``limit``, ``offset``) follow common conventions

Database Schema
---------------

Simple Three-Table Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Use three core tables (Users, Projects, Tasks) with clear foreign key relationships.

**Schema**::

   User (1) ──── (N) Project (1) ──── (N) Task

**Rationale**:

* Minimal complexity while meeting all functional requirements
* Clear ownership model (users own projects, projects contain tasks)
* Cascade deletes maintain referential integrity automatically
* Easy to understand and query

**Alternative considered**: Many-to-many relationship between users and projects was considered but rejected due to YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle - the additional complexity wasn't justified by current requirements.

Indexing Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Create indexes on frequently queried columns:

* ``users.email`` (unique index)
* ``projects.user_id`` (foreign key index)
* ``tasks.project_id`` (foreign key index)

**Rationale**:

* Email-based authentication requires fast user lookups
* Project filtering by owner is a common operation
* Task queries by project are performance-critical
* Foreign key indexes improve JOIN performance

**Trade-offs**: Indexes consume storage space and slow down writes slightly, but read performance gains justify this for a read-heavy application.

Timestamp Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Every table includes ``created_at`` and ``updated_at`` timestamps, automatically managed.

**Rationale**:

* Audit trail for all data changes
* Enables sorting by creation/modification time
* Supports potential future features (activity feeds, change tracking)
* UTC storage prevents timezone confusion

SQLite for Development, PostgreSQL-Ready
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Use SQLite by default with configuration support for PostgreSQL.

**Rationale**:

* SQLite enables zero-configuration local development
* No external database service required for testing
* SQLAlchemy ORM abstracts database differences
* Production can easily switch to PostgreSQL via ``DATABASE_URL`` environment variable

Authentication & Security
-------------------------

JWT Token-Based Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Implement stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens with separate access and refresh tokens.

**Token Lifetimes**:

* Access token: 1 hour
* Refresh token: 30 days

**Rationale**:

* **Stateless**: No server-side session storage required, enabling horizontal scaling
* **Decoupled**: Frontend and backend can be deployed independently
* **Mobile-friendly**: Tokens work seamlessly in mobile apps
* **Refresh mechanism**: Short-lived access tokens limit exposure while refresh tokens provide convenience

**Alternatives considered**:

* **Session-based auth**: Rejected due to scaling complexity (requires shared session store)
* **OAuth 2.0**: Overkill for this use case; adds unnecessary complexity without third-party integration needs

**Trade-offs**: JWT tokens cannot be revoked before expiration. Mitigated by short access token lifetime and refresh token rotation strategy.

Bcrypt Password Hashing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Hash passwords using bcrypt with automatic salting.

**Rationale**:

* Industry-standard for password hashing
* Built-in salt generation prevents rainbow table attacks
* Adaptive cost factor allows increasing complexity over time
* Slow by design, making brute-force attacks impractical

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Implement two user roles (Manager, Employee) with decorator-based authorization.

**Roles**:

* **Manager**: Full CRUD access to users, projects, and tasks
* **Employee**: Read access + task management

**Rationale**:

* Simple two-tier system meets current requirements
* Decorator pattern (``@manager_required``) keeps authorization logic DRY
* Easy to extend with additional roles if needed
* Centralized authorization logic in middleware reduces bugs

**Alternative considered**: Attribute-based access control (ABAC) was too complex for current needs.

Optimizations
-------------

Lazy Loading with Opt-In Includes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Related data (projects in user responses, tasks in project responses) is not included by default but can be requested via query parameters.

**Examples**:

* ``GET /users/1?include_projects=true``
* ``GET /projects/1?include_tasks=true``

**Rationale**:

* Reduces payload size for common queries (N+1 problem avoidance)
* Clients only fetch data they need, reducing bandwidth
* Improves response times for simple queries
* SQLAlchemy's lazy loading prevents unnecessary database hits

**Trade-offs**: Requires clients to know about include parameters, but documentation makes this clear.

Pagination Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: List endpoints support ``limit`` and ``offset`` query parameters.

**Defaults**: Sensible defaults prevent accidentally loading thousands of records.

**Rationale**:

* Prevents performance degradation with large datasets
* Reduces memory consumption on server
* Enables efficient client-side infinite scroll implementations
* Standard pattern familiar to developers

In-Memory Testing Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Tests use SQLite in-memory database (``:memory:``).

**Rationale**:

* Extremely fast test execution (no disk I/O)
* Clean state for each test run
* No test pollution between runs
* Reduces CI/CD pipeline time

Connection Pooling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: SQLAlchemy's built-in connection pooling is enabled by default.

**Rationale**:

* Reuses database connections, reducing overhead
* Handles connection lifecycle automatically
* Improves throughput under concurrent load
* Zero configuration required

Input Validation Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Separate validator modules for each feature (``validators.py`` in each blueprint).

**Rationale**:

* Early request rejection saves database queries
* Centralized validation logic prevents duplication
* Clear error messages improve developer experience
* Separates validation from business logic

**Example**: Email format validation, required field checks, enum validation for user types and task statuses.

Structured Logging with Loguru
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Use Loguru instead of Python's standard logging module.

**Rationale**:

* Color-coded console output improves development experience
* Structured logging supports future log aggregation
* Zero configuration with sensible defaults
* Better exception formatting and context

**Trade-offs**: Additional dependency, but benefits outweigh the minimal overhead.
